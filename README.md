# ProductionLine
IPSI3 - SchoolProject

A production line supervision. 
We developed a C# based set of HMI screens allowing the user to supervise and control production lines. 
A C++/C# wrapper was used to do the industrial vision controls and Modbus communication with the production line simulators. 
These simulators are straton runtimes programmed to replicate the hardware functioning of various PLCs and manufacturing actions.
